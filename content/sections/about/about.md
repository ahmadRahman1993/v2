Hello! I’m Ahmad Rahman, a Full-Stack Software Engineer and AI Specialist dedicated to leveraging technology for impactful solutions. My journey through computer science has been marked by a commitment to innovation, continuous learning, and a passion for problem-solving.

My technical expertise spans advanced web and server-side development, database management, and AI system development. I’m proficient in a range of programming languages and database systems, enabling me to build comprehensive and robust solutions.

After graduating summa cum laude in Computer Science from National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, I pursued a Master of Science at the University of Saskatchewan. My thesis on "[Deadline-Aware Reservation-Based Scheduling](https://harvest.usask.ca/server/api/core/bitstreams/8e79a7ca-1069-403a-8241-08ce3ff4466a/content)" honed my research and analytical skills. Professionally, I've worked with the University of Saskatchewan and Netpace in San Francisco, where I developed AI models and data-driven applications, leading teams to create scalable and efficient solutions.

Beyond my professional endeavors, I volunteer for Canada Learning Code, demonstrating my commitment to giving back to the community and promoting digital literacy and coding skills across Canada.

I am driven by the belief that technology can transform lives and industries. I aim to remain at the cutting edge of AI and cloud computing, exploring how these technologies can drive progress and innovation.
